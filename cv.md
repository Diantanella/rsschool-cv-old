##### Some information about me

I am 22 years old, I have experience in Social Media Marketing (SMM). I promoted other people's businesses (such as high-level furniture, plastic surgery and beauty salons) by improving their social media accounts and by creating small landing pages.

Now I am wondering in Web Development because it hepls me in realizing my potential and can give me many advantages such as endless opportunities for professional growth.

I think that my purposefulness and my huge ability to learn will help me to become a successful developer!
